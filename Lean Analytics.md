<ul>
<li>Analytics is the necessary counterweight to lying.</li>
<li>Instincts are experiments. Data is proof.</li>
<li>“Without productivity objectives, a business does not have direction. without productivity measurements, it does not have control”, Peter Drucker wrote.</li>
<li>The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is the smallest thing you can build that will create the value you’ve promised to your market. But nowhere in that de nition does it say how much of that o ering has to be real. A Concierge MVP won’t scale.</li>
<li>Lean, analytical thinking is about asking the right questions, and focusing on the one key metric that will produce the change you’re after.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-keep-score">How to Keep Score</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The purpose of analytics is to find your way to the right product and market before the money runs out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A good metric is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Comparative (to other time periods, groups of people, or competitors)</li>
<li>Understandable (so people could remember it and discuss it. change in the data, change in the culture.)</li>
<li>A ratio or rate (as accountants and financial analysts have, e.g. price-to-earnings ratio, sales margins, the cost of sales, revenue per employee). Ratios tend to be the best metrics, because they are:
<ul>
<li>Easier to act on: In a car, speed (distance per hour) is easier to act on compared to distance travelled.</li>
<li>Inherently comparative: In a car, speed is one metric, but speed right now over average speed this hour shows you a lot about whether you’re accelerating or slowing down.</li>
<li>good for comparing factors that are somehow opposed: e.g. free/premium effect on sales or user acqusition.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It changes the way you behave: e.g. “Experimental” metrics.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Metrics often come in pairs</strong><br>
Conversion rate &amp; time-ti-purchase -&gt; cash flow<br>
viral coefficient &amp; viral cycle time -&gt; adoption rate</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Metrics categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Qualitative vs. quantitative</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vanity vs. actionable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exploratory vs. reporting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leading vs. lagging: e.g. customer complaints vs. order cancellations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Correlated vs. causal: Correlation is good. Causality is great.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rather than running a series of separate tests one after the other—which will delay your learning cycle—you can analyze them all at once using a technique called multivariate analysis.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Includes nothing really related to Data!</p>
<h2 id="data-driven-versus-data-informed">Data-Driven Versus Data-Informed</h2>
<ul>
<li>Math is good at optimizing a known system; humans are good at finding a new one. <em>Change favors local maxima; innovation favors global disruption.</em></li>
<li>Outliers neither should be excluded, nor included. They should be looked at from a qualitative perspective.</li>
<li>Mashing up your data with data from other sources can lead to valuable insights.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="finding-the-right-metric-for-right-now">Finding the Right Metric for Right Now</h2>
<h2 id="analytics-frameworks">Analytics Frameworks</h2>
<ol>
<li>Dave McClure’s Pirate Metrics
<ul>
<li>Acquisition: <em>Traffic, mentions, cost per click, search results, cost of acquisition, open rate</em></li>
<li>Activation: <em>Enrollments, signups, completed onboarding process, used the service at least once, subscriptions</em></li>
<li>Retention: <em>Engagement, time since last visit, daily and monthly active use, churns</em></li>
<li>Revenue: <em>Customer lifetime value, conversion rate, shopping cart size, click-through revenue</em></li>
<li>Referral: <em>Invites sent, viral coefficient, viral cycle time</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Eric Ries’s Engines of Growth
<ul>
<li>Sticky Engine: Stickiness isn’t only about retention, it’s also about frequency, which is why you also need to track metrics like time since last visit.</li>
<li>Virality Engine: <em>Viral coefficient, the actions that make up the cycle, viral cycle time, the type of virality</em></li>
<li>Paid Engine: <em>Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), time to customer breakeven</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-discipline-of-one-metric-that-matters">The Discipline of One Metric That Matters</h2>
<p><strong>OMTM</strong>: the One Metric That Matters<br>
<em>VP of Growth Marketting at Moz</em>: “Every team reports to the entire company weekly on KPIs, movement, and summaries. We also have a huge screen up in the office pumping out customer counts and free trial counts.”</p>
<ul>
<li>The OMTM changes depending on your current stage, and in some cases it will change quickly.</li>
<li>You need to pick a number, set it as the target, and have enough confidence that if you hit it, you consider it success.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-business-are-you-in">What Business Are You In?</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Sergio Zyman, Coca-Cola’s CMO</em>: “Marketing is about selling more stuff to more people more often for more money more efficiently.”</li>
<li>You need to segment real, valuable users from drive-by, curious, or detrimental ones. Then you need to make changes that maximize the real users and weed out the bad ones. A subtle approach could be not trying to reactivate disengaged users once they’ve been gone for a while.</li>
<li>Predicting revenues accurately relies on an understanding of how its different user segments employ the product.
<ul>
<li>Freemium isn’t a business model—it’s a marketing tactic.</li>
<li>SaaS isn’t a business model—it’s a way of delivering software.</li>
<li>The ads on a media site aren’t a business model—they’re a way of collecting revenue.<br>
<strong>Acquisition Channel</strong>: How people find out about you.</li>
<li>Paid advertizing</li>
<li>Search engine management</li>
<li>Social media outreach</li>
<li>…<br>
<strong>Selling Tactic</strong>: How you convince<br>
visitors to become users, or<br>
users to become customers.</li>
<li>Simple purchase</li>
<li>Discounts and incentives</li>
<li>Free trial</li>
<li>Freemium</li>
<li>Pay-for-privacy</li>
<li>Free-to-play<br>
<strong>Revenue Source</strong>: How you make money.</li>

</ul>

</ul>
<p><strong>Product Type</strong>: What value your business offers in return for the revenue.<br>
<strong>Delivery Model</strong>: How you get your product to the customer.</p>
