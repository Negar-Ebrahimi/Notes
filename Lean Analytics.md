## Stop Lying to Yourself

 - Analytics is the necessary counterweight to lying.
 - Instincts are experiments. Data is proof.
 - “Without productivity objectives, a business does not have direction. without productivity measurements, it does not have control”, Peter Drucker wrote.
- The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is the smallest thing you can build that will create the value you’ve promised to your market. But nowhere in that de nition does it say how much of that o ering has to be real. A Concierge MVP won’t scale.
- Lean, analytical thinking is about asking the right questions, and focusing on the one key metric that will produce the change you’re after.

## How to Keep Score
- In a startup, you don’t always know which metrics are key, but the purpose of analytics is to find your way to the right product and market before the money runs out.
- A good metric is:
	1. Comparative (to other time periods, groups of people, or competitors)
	2. Understandable (so people could remember it and discuss it. change in the data, change in the culture.)
	3. A ratio or rate (as accountants and financial analysts have, e.g. price-to-earnings ratio, sales margins, the cost of sales, revenue per employee). Ratios tend to be the best metrics, because they are:
		- Easier to act on: In a car, speed (distance per hour) is easier to act on compared to distance travelled.
		- Inherently comparative: In a car, speed is one metric, but speed right now over average speed this hour shows you a lot about whether you’re accelerating or slowing down.
